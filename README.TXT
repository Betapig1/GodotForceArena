First things first, the controls

Traditions MKB WASD movement, click on any of the cubes to pick them up, and click them again to throw them at your opponent! Last person alive wins!

For joining a hosted game, there is a system set up that broadcasts the running port on port 50000, and assuming no firewalls blocking the broadcast, if you click the "Look for games" button you should see any open LAN games pop up.

If there is a firewall blocking it, then the hosted game will have a listed port on the UI, so just grab the hosts local IP with command prompt or whatever you perfer, fill out the info in the menu, and click "Join with IP"!

There is also one known error that I wanted to point out, that is due to a bug in godot as found by the pull request here https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/92358
